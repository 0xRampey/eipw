				<h2>Explanation</h2>

				<p>
					<code>markdown-rel-links</code> reports any non-relative
					(eg. absolute or protocol-relative) hyperlinks or images in
					proposals, with exceptions defined in
					<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1#linking-to-external-resources">EIP-1</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Proposals cannot contain external links for several reasons.
					First and foremost is that external links can disappear,
					move, or otherwise suffer from
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a>.
					Final proposals provide a guarantee of immutability, and
					updating final proposals to update links would undermine
					that guarantee.
				</p>

				<p>
					In a similar vein, an external resource (referred to by a
					non-relative URL) can change independently of the EIP
					process, which would also undermine the immutability
					guarantee.
				</p>

				<p>
					Finally, there is also the question of copyright, access
					fees, and general availability. Proposals are licensed under
					<a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/">CC0-1.0</a>
					so that anyone is free to use them for whatever purpose.
					Content published outside the EIPs repository is likely not
					licensed under the same terms. Publishers may even charge a
					fee for access!
