				<h2>Explanation</h2>

				<p>
					<code>markdown-req-section</code> makes sure all the
					sections required in
					<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1#what-belongs-in-a-successful-eip">EIP-1</a>
					are present.
				</p>

				<p>
					The sections required by this lint provide valuable context
					for readers and editors, and details necessary for
					implementers. Proposals without these sections would be too
					incomplete to be used.
				</p>

				<p>
					It is convention that no headings in the markdown file use
					level one (i.e. <code># Some Heading</code>.) All sections
					should be at level two (<code>## Some Heading</code>) or
					deeper. Headings required by this lint must be at exactly
					level two.
