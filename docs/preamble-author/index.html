				<h2>Explanation</h2>

				<p>
					<code>preamble-author</code> makes sure that the
					<code>author</code> field in the front matter (or preamble)
					matches the format understood by other tools. It also makes
					sure that every proposal has at least one author with a
					GitHub username.
				</p>

				<p>
					Specifically, each author must have a name, optionally
					followed by an email address enclosed in less-than /
					greater-than signs (<code>&lt;...&gt;</code>) or a GitHub
					username enclosed in parentheses (<code>(...)</code>.)
					Multiple authors should be separated by a comma. If, for
					some reason, an author wants to have both an email address
					and a GitHub username, make separate author entries (eg.
					<code>Jacob Carter (@JCarter), Jacob Carter &lt;selmak@example.com&gt;</code>.)
				</p>

				<p>
					Each proposal must have at least one author identified with
					a GitHub username because the <code>author</code> field is
					used for access control: someone has to be able to approve
					pull requests.
