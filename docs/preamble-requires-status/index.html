			<h1><code>preamble-requires-status</code></h1>
			<p>
				EIPs listed in <code>requires</code> have statuses further along
				than the current proposal.

				<h2>Examples</h2>

				<pre>error[preamble-requires-status]: preamble header `requires` contains items not stable enough for a `status` of `Final`
 --&gt; eip-20.md:9:10
  |
9 | requires: 3074
  |          ^^^^^ has a less advanced status
  |
  = help: valid `status` values for this proposal are: `Draft`, `Stagnant`</pre>

				<h2>Explanation</h2>

				<p>
					<code>preamble-requires-status</code> checks the front
					matter (or preamble) field <code>requires</code> for other
					proposals that are not as far along in the standardization
					process.
				</p>

				<p>
					Final proposals are, for the most part, immutable. A link
					from a final proposal to a non-final proposal introduces
					mutability: the non-final proposal could be completely
					rewritten, changing the meaning of the final proposal.
				</p>

				<p>
					There are two solutions: remove the reference to the other
					proposal, or help the authors of the other proposal move
					through the standardization process.
