				<pre>error[markdown-link-status]: proposal `eip-20.md` is not stable enough for a `status` of `Last Call`
  --> input.md

15 | This is the abstract for the EIP which needs [EIP-20](./eip-20.md).

				<h2>Explanation</h2>

				<p>
					<code>markdown-link-status</code> checks the body of a
					proposal for links to other proposals that are not as far
					along in the standardization process.
				</p>

				<p>
					Final proposals are, for the most part, immutable. A link
					from a final proposal to a non-final proposal introduces
					mutability: the non-final proposal could be completely
					rewritten, changing the meaning of the final proposal.
